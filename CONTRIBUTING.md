# How to Contribute to this Project

Use [gitflow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) to develop, try to use this practice whenever you can.

Try to define a small phrase for the feature branch like (`feature/user-login`) and refer to the corresponding issues in your commit messages (`Call to API login #123`).

When you're done with development create a new Pull Request and add a close/fix declaration on the Pull Request description to autoclose the related issues on merge.

<small>_**Note:** If the project hasn't any related issue you should create one to refer your commit messages to it._</small>

## Bugs & issues

Create one issue for each bug or fix you want to do or group them by functionality. The branch naming should be equal to the one used in features (`bugfix/login-bugs`).

## Hotfixes

Try to develop it in a separate branch (`hotfix/login`) merge it to `master` by Pull Request and use the Pull Request as your bug issue (tag it with `bug`).


## Pull Requests

Try to assign at least one reviewer on your Pull Request and try to not assign them always to the same person and tag them accordingly.
